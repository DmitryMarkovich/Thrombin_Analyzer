This application performs data analysis in thrombin generation experiments.
 
Start with loading a calibration signal via *Calibration data file input*. The loaded signal is plotted in `Calibration signal` tab. Next, choose a model to fit the signal from the options in *Select model to fit calibration signal*. Parameters obtained after fitting the signal are displayed in `Parameters` tab.

Proceed with loading a thrombin generation signal via *Thrombin generation data file input*. The loaded signal is plotted in `Thrombin generation signal` tab. `Thrombogram` tab will show the first and the second derivative obtained from raw data. Choose a model to fit the loaded signal from the option in *Select model to fit thrombin generation signal*.

After the two fits are performed, all parameters are displayed in `Parameters` tab. Enter the value of the calibration factor to calibrate the parameters of thrombin generation signal.

In case there are no data on Your computer, download some of the provided demo signals by choosing from options in *Select a demo signal to try out models on data!*. The data is visualized in `Demo signals` tab. Download data, and analyze it choosing a suitable model.

Application is also available [online](https://dmitriymarkovich.shinyapps.io/Thrombin_Analyzer/).

Good luck!
